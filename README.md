## :scroll: Description
Swipe right to adopt! (well, more accurately click heart to adopt. Flick gestures didn't make the cut)


## :bulb: Motivation and Context
My motivation for this one sort of getting a swipe left/swipe right feel when looking through the puppies, and making sure the puppies were front and center. So even if you didn't end up adopting, you could still look through an infinite gallery of puppies.
